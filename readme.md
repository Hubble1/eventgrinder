#What is this crazy thing?

This branch is about porting Eventgrinder a plain old Django project (it was previously only suited for AppEngine).

Expect AppEngine compatibility to break. In exchange, it should work in MANY more places.

Much of the actual functionality will actually be implemented in compoundcalendar https://github.com/rosskarchner/compoundcalendar .

This branch will eventually become master.
